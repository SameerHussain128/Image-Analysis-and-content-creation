# Gemini-AI-Projects

Developed an generative AI system capable of creating accurate text from textual prompts and performing detailed image analysis, leveraging cutting-edge generative models.

The Gemini AI project focuses on the application of generative models for both image synthesis and analysis. The system allows users to input image and write prompts and it analysis image generates accurate text based on those prompts.

USE - User have to upload image in 'drag and drop file/Browse file' then click Explain breif about image the model will deep analysis image and give information
